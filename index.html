A regional finalist 		in the 2008 Kerr- ville New Folk Songwriting Contest, Grace is the daughter of 		Pierce Pettis, much beloved folk artist.</p>				<p>Grace likes daisies, diet coke, and most of all, writing about herself in the third 		person. She is currently in the process of raising money to re- cord her first album. 		Grace is cur- rently writing and playing original music in Austin, TX. Grace carries a 		plethora of songs around in her head and is constantly writing more, some- times 		two or three new songs a week.</p>

		<h3>Soundwave</h3>
		<p>If you have never seen <a href="http://www.myspace.com/soundwaveonline">Soundwave</a> perform live, you are in for a great surprise. 		Rest assured you wonâ€™t be leaving their show without a positive and encouraging 		message of trust which travels straight to the heart.</p>		<p>The band, led by lead singer/songwriter and guitarist Jeremy Rodriguez, got 		started several years ago in the small town of Lockhart, TX. Their first public 		perform- ance was for a rally in Austin. The energy of the crowd motivated 		Soundwave to continue playing. Drawing on his personal experiences, Jeremy 		has written songs that are very real and personal with the hope of reaching out to 		others. Our vision is to share our experiences with other people and to write 		great music. There is so much negativity in the world today, both lyrically and 		musically, and people are being fed a counterfeit trust, so we want to encourage 		them to live life to the fullest and search for the Truth.</p>
