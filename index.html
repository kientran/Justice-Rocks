		<h3>Grace Pettis</h3>
		<p><a href="http://www.gracepettis.com">Grace Pettis</a> is the 22-year-old daughter of Pierce Pettis, and has just released her debut, self-titled CD, Grace Pettis, on the Blue Rock Artists label.  Already, Grace has begun to earn national recognition, with her 2009 win at the Mountain Stage NewSong Songwriting Competition.  Grace performed on the prestigious Mountain Stage radio show for NPR, and was also awarded NewSong's "best song" award for her "Nine to Five Girl." </p>

		<h3>Soundwave</h3>
		<p>If you have never seen <a href="http://www.myspace.com/soundwaveonline">Soundwave</a> perform live, you are in for a great surprise. 		Rest assured you wonâ€™t be leaving their show without a positive and encouraging 		message of trust which travels straight to the heart.</p>		<p>The band, led by lead singer/songwriter and guitarist Jeremy Rodriguez, got 		started several years ago in the small town of Lockhart, TX. Their first public 		perform- ance was for a rally in Austin. The energy of the crowd motivated 		Soundwave to continue playing. Drawing on his personal experiences, Jeremy 		has written songs that are very real and personal with the hope of reaching out to 		others. Our vision is to share our experiences with other people and to write 		great music. There is so much negativity in the world today, both lyrically and 		musically, and people are being fed a counterfeit trust, so we want to encourage 		them to live life to the fullest and search for the Truth.</p>
